- **Discrepancy Reports**: Detailed reports for audit purposes
- **Formatted Output**: Properly formatted CSV with headers

## Assumptions Made

### Data Format Assumptions
- **Currency**: All amounts in Kenyan Shillings (KSh)
- **CSV Structure**: Standard comma-separated format with headers
- **Required Columns**: transaction_reference, amount, status
- **Unique Identifiers**: transaction_reference serves as primary matching key
- **No FX Conversion**: Single currency assumption (KSh)

### Business Logic Assumptions
- **Exact Matching**: Transactions match only on identical reference IDs
- **Status Values**: Accepts any string values (completed, pending, failed, etc.)
- **Amount Precision**: Supports decimal values with standard floating-point precision
- **Case Sensitivity**: Transaction references are case-sensitive

### Technical Assumptions
- **Client-side Processing**: No server-side data storage or processing
- **Modern Browser Support**: ES2020+ JavaScript features
- **File Size Limits**: Browser memory constraints for large CSV files
- **Network Independence**: Fully functional offline after initial load

## Improvements for Extended Development

### Immediate Enhancements (1-2 weeks)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter results by amount range, status, or date patterns
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select functionality for batch exports
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage for session recovery
- **Print Functionality**: Formatted reports for physical documentation
- **Enhanced Validation**: More sophisticated CSV structure validation

### Medium-term Features (1-2 months)
